# SOC Automation Lab

## Objective

This lab project was developed to simulate and detect cyber attacks in a controlled environment, with a focus on identifying the use of Mimikatz.exeâ€”a tool commonly used to extract plaintext credentials from Windows memory and perform code injection. The core objective was to generate test telemetry that reflects real-world attack behavior and analyze the resulting logs through a SIEM platform. This hands-on setup provided valuable experience in network defense, threat detection, and understanding how different attack techniques can be identified and mitigated using modern security tools.

### Skills Learned

- Gained a strong understanding of how SIEM systems operate, including core concepts and real-world application.
- Improved ability to analyze network logs and identify meaningful security events.
- Developed the skills to explain attack signatures and deepened knowledge of common security vulnerabilities.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Experienced real-time alerting scenarios, which enhanced problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- **SIEM & Log Management**  
  - Wazuh (manager and agent)  
  - Filebeat (log shipper)  
  - Sysmon (Windows system monitoring and event logging)

- **Threat Detection & Response**  
  - TheHive (case management platform)  
  - Shuffle SOAR (automated alert handling and workflow orchestration)

- **Monitoring & Visualization**  
  - Wazuh Dashboard (real-time alert monitoring)

- **Operating Systems & Environments**  
  - Ubuntu (Wazuh server and Shuffle host)  
  - Windows 10 VM (endpoint with Sysmon for attack simulation)

- **Infrastructure & Network Security**  
  - VirtualBox (for local virtualized test environments)  
  - Custom firewall rules (for cloud VM segmentation and security testing)
